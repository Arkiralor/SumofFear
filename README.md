# SumofFear
C++ Program to solve the "Sum of Fear" problem using OOP.
This problem can be summarised as:
  given a set S, an operator * and a value x,
  find all a*b = x |a, b Îµ S

In the given example the operator * is defined as '+'.

S is defined as {a, b, c, d} where a, b, c, and d are defined by the user. S can easily be edited to incorporate more or less values by editing the value of |sumoffear::array[]|.

x is a user-defined value.
